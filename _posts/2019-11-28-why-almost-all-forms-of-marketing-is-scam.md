title: Why almost all forms of marketing is Scam: A research!
---
Almost all form of marketing is ineffective. 
 
Question is why is this so ?.
 
Because the questions that are being asked by almost all marketing experts are ineffective.
 
Why are the questions are ineffective ?.
 
Because they are not based upon the truth.
 
And if questions are not based upon The Truth, the answer one will get can not be truth. 
 
In to order to understand the truth about marketing, one must first devote himself to understanding the human nature. 

Or precisely we can say, one must devote himself to understading the nature of human mind. 

So Ask yourself, you know any of marketing expert who done such thing. 

Have to you heard any of the marketing expert who , rather than going to school or getting a 

marketing degree or working at a marketing firm or something similiar, has devoted himself to 

learning about human mind and human nature before trying to convince a single human being on the planet to hire him?.

The truth is that human being( your costumer) do not care about what the marketing experts think. 

The Truth is that human beings do not act in ways that marketers think they should act.

Most of the marketing experts are addicted to "features and benifits"
