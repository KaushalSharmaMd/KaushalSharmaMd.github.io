title: Why almost all forms of marketing is Scam.
---

Almost all form of marketing is ineffective. 
 
Question is why is this so ?.
 
Because the questions that are being asked by almost all marketing experts are ineffective.
 
Why are the questions are ineffective ?.
 
Because they are not based upon the truth.
 
And if questions are not based upon The Truth, the answer one will get can not be truth. 
 
In order to understand the truth about marketing, one must first devote himself to understanding the human nature. 

Or precisely we can say, one must devote himself to understading the nature of human mind. 

So Ask yourself, you know any of marketing expert who done such thing. 

Have to you heard any of the marketing expert who , rather than going to school or getting a marketing degree or working at a marketing firm or something similiar, has devoted himself to learning about human mind and human nature before trying to convince a single human being on the planet to hire him?.

The truth is that human being( your costumer) do not care about what the marketing experts think. 

The Truth is that human beings do not act in ways that marketers think they should act.

Most of the marketing experts are addicted to "features and benifits", this may be aurprize to many people,but "feature and benifits" are not the top of the humans's priority list. 

Marketing experts are addicted to the "price", but the price matters in ways that are entirely opposite to the ways marketing experts think it matters. 

Marketing experts view human being through the lens of Logic and Research. 

Firstly, if human behaviour is predictable, it is on account of things that have 

nothing to do with logic. 

Second, almost all research is skewed and flawed. For researchers ask questions that are 

1) far too narrow and self-serving, and 

2) do not take into account the nuances and complexities of the human mind.

Understand this: Any business that hires a marketing firm is getting relieved of their money 

for little to nothing in return.

I will conclude with a few Truths, minimally explained. For it is not about the “instruction,” but the Essence, of the message.

The one who sells the most is the one who cares not to sell it. 

The one who will never starve is the one who captivates the hearts of humans.

Captivating human hearts is not a flower that can grow in the soil of “sales presentations” and “marketing strategies.”

For all sales presentations and marketing strategies are founded upon impurity and ulterior motive.

What seems to be lost on marketing an advertising agency is that the human being has an inner sense to detect what is not geniun. Thus preventing his heart from being captivated.

The company that seeks to make "extra money” is well-suited to the marketer who knows nothing about marketing. 

Humans, it seems, have become conditioned to ignore their truly glorious capabilities.

The wise company will understand that it sits at the center of a flea market. If it truly seeks to do something grand, there is no “marketing agency” in existence that has sufficiently devoted its life to become worthy of their call.

If the product that a company is selling requires a “convincing” of the customer, rather than creating an instant and dramatic emotional reaction within him ( Apple  users can understand here ) , the company will struggle.

If the product that a company is selling requires a “convincing” of the customer, rather than creating an instant and dramatic emotional reaction within him, the company will struggle.

A company has found something truly magical (and easily profitable) if it creates the feeling that no price can possibly do justice to its worth.

For one may fool the mind, but he will never fool the Heart.
